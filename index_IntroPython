Introduct to Python

Overview
This 3-day course introduces the student to the Python language. Upon completion of this class, the student will be able to write non trivial Python programs dealing with a wide variety of subject matter domains. Topics include language components, working with a professional IDE, control flow constructs, strings, I/O, collections, classes, modules, and regular expressions. The course is supplemented with many hands-on labs, solutions, and code examples.

Audience
Anyone who needs to learn how to write programs in Python or wants solid exposure to Python as their first programming language.

Prerequisites
Optimally, students will have experience with at least one programming or scripting language e.g., C, C++, Java, etc. This being said, students with a technical inclination with experience developing projects like spreadsheets, SPSS scripts, Bash scripts, or macros are welcome to join. Python is a great first language--it is very approachable and easy to learn.
